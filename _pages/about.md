I'm currently a Machine Learning Scientist in [Fable Therapeutics](https://www.fabletherapeutics.com/), where I joined as the first member and serve as a core contributor of the generative AI team. Our mission is to develop cutting-edge generative models for protein design and therapeutic discovery.


From bench to code
======
Like many biology undergraduates, I was fascinated by the mysteries of life—especially those surrounding disease. Questions like Why does cancer occur? and How can we treat it? inspired me to study at the School of Life Sciences, Peking University, the top 2 university in China. In my third year, I joined a research lab focused on colorectal cancer just as single-cell RNA sequencing technology was emerging. This powerful technique allowed gene expression to be analyzed at the resolution of individual cells, offering far more detail than traditional bulk tissue analysis.

Our projects aimed to understand why immune cells infiltrated in colorectal tumors often fail to eliminate cancer cells. Over the next two years, I worked primarily at the bench: isolating tumor tissues into single-cell suspensions, sorting immune cell subtypes using FACS (Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting) based on surface markers, constructing cDNA libraries, and generating sequencing data via Illumina platforms. However, all downstream analysis was handled by a bioinformatics PhD student. Despite the intense hands-on work, I found myself increasingly frustrated by my limited role— disconnected from the most meaningful part of the research—the insights hidden in the data.

This experience motivated me to take control of the analytical process. I began learning programming and statistics on my own, determined to bridge the gap between experimental biology and data science. That decision marked the start of my transition from the wet lab to the world of computational biology and machine learning. Today, I work with datasets that span millions of sequences, structures, and features. What began as a desire to answer questions in cancer biology has evolved into a broader mission: to develop intelligent systems that uncover patterns in biological data and accelerate therapeutic discovery 


All about therapeutics targets
======
My early experience in colorectal cancer research introduced me to the process of identifying therapeutic targets—be they specific cell types, dysregulated signaling pathways, or individual proteins expressed on the cell surface. I came to appreciate that target discovery is probably only the beginning. The next challenge is designing molecules that can precisely engage these targets to block, activate, or modulate their function.

This naturally led to my growing interest in binder design, especially therapeutic antibodies. I became fascinated with how structure, sequence, and binding specificity could be modeled and optimized computationally. What once felt like futuristic science—designing a molecule in silico to bind a target with high affinity—is now the core of my day-to-day work. And I remain deeply enthusiastic about advancing generative models that can propose such binders, bringing us closer to faster, smarter therapeutic development.


This is just the beginning. More to come...
