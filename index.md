I'm currently a Machine Learning Scientist in [Fable Therapeutics](https://www.fabletherapeutics.com/), where I joined as the first member and serve as a core contributor of the generative AI team. My research focuses on antibody sequence and structure designs, and leveraging cutting-edge generative models for therapeutics discovery.

- Interests: binder design, therapeutics discovery, applied deep learning models
